# Perovskite-Properties


# Structural properties of the inorganic lattice $\rm BX_6$ 

It is easy to compute structural properties of molecules or simple book geometries. Features such as bond length and angles between atoms can be captured manually at first sight. However, a more robust geometry can be demanding and stressful to manage. That is when we welcome scripts to get these tasks done in a fast and relaxed way.

Perovskite geometries are complex and need patience to extract all wanted properties. 3D and 2D structures have a complex web of octrahedrals that are challenging and time-consuming. Thus, we wrote a set of scripts to do this task for us. They read geometries from 2D (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 layers) and 3D through Python script. This page will detail the recommended input unitcell/supercell structure.

This set of scripts are a post-processing tool for structural output. However, it could also be used for initial structures.
